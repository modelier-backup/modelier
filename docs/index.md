# Modelier Docs

`Modelier` is a standard, [activerecord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern)
like interface for communication with external, async resources, such as databases,
http, etc. It is modeled after the ruby
[ActiveRecord](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html) querying
interface, but operates in Promises and built for the modern ES7 async/await
environment.
